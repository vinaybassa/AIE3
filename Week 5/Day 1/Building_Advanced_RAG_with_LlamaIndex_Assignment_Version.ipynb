        "- `QueryEngine` -> `LCEL Chain`:\n",
        "  -  `QueryEngine` is just LlamaIndex's way of indicating something is an LLM \"chain\" on top of a retrieval system\n",
        "- `OpenAIAgent` vs. `Agent`:\n",
        "  - The two agents have the same fundamental pattern: Decide which of a list of tools to use to answer a user's query.\n",
        "  - `OpenAIAgent` (LlamaIndex's primary agent) does not need to rely on an agent excecutor due to the fact that it is leveraging OpenAI's [functional api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) which allows the agent to interface \"directly\" with the tools instead of operating through an intermediary application process.\n",

        "We won't be leveraging those structured indicies today, but we will be leveraging a \"benefit\" of the `node` structure that exists as a default in LlamaIndex, which is the ability to quickly filter nodes based on their metadata.\n",
